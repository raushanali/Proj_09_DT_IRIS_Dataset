# Proj_09_DT_IRIS_Dataset

This project uses the scikit-learn library to classify iris flower species based on their physical measurements. It employs a Decision Tree Classifier model, which is a powerful machine learning algorithm.

Purpose
Classify iris flowers into 3 species based on 4 features (sepal length/width, petal length/width)

Evaluate the performance of the Decision Tree model

Visualize and understand the model

Features
Dataset: Iris dataset (150 samples, 3 classes)

Model: Decision Tree Classifier (max_depth=3)

Visualization:

Plot tree (plot_tree)

Interactive tree using Graphviz

Text representation

Evaluation Metrics:

Confusion matrix

Accuracy score

Requirements
Python 3.x

scikit-learn

matplotlib

Results Interpretation
Confusion Matrix: Shows correct and incorrect predictions

Accuracy Score: Overall model accuracy (typically >90%)

Decision Tree: Helps understand the model's decision-making rules
