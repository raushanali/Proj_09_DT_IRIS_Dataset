#The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, 
#The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, 
#and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as 
#some properties about each flower.
# The 3 species of iris are
#Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor

#The columns in this dataset are:    
#Id
#SepalLengthCm
#SepalWidthCm
#PetalLengthCm
#PetalWidthCm
#Species
